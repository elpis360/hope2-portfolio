The brand currently operates in England, the USA, and France, with a primary focus on catering to women aged between 16 and 25.",

This includes anticipating their needs from the moment they land on the website or app, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable navigation experience, and providing clear and helpful information throughout the shopping process.",
